    "text": "Welcome to Intertidal’s resource home for ocean data stewards! \nData stewardship is central to Intertidal’s work connecting ocean data to action. Data stewards are individuals and teams within governments, communities, research groups, nonprofits, and businesses who make data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (aka FAIR). Without ocean data stewards, it’s much harder to find and recombine ocean data to make new discoveries, monitor ocean conditions, and design solutions. Anyone who works with ocean data and information can practice ocean data stewardship. These are some of the resources we’ve developed and tested with our partners. Try them out and see how they can support your ocean data stewardship practices.\n To submit feedback, ask questions or suggest additional topics you’d like to see added, please contact us.",

    "text": "Background\nSuccessful data sharing requires putting data where it can be discovered and reused. These places are data repositories; persistent, findable, searchable entities that provides infrastructure for long-term storage and access to data. A repository should provide for data publication by data holders, as well as access for using/reusing data. It should not be a place into which data is contributed without any way to retrieve it in the future. Intertidal has developed this list of repository evaluation criteria that synthesizes multiple sources (see Resources and Guidelines), and indicates “should have” criteria (no asterisk) and “nice to have” criteria (asterisk).\nIndividual researchers and data holders may already have preferred subject matter repositories where they regularly publish and access data (e.g. the Global Biodiversity Information Forum, aka GBIF). However, for projects that span a wide range of fields and data types (e.g. eDNA, underwater video, satellite images, socioeconomic data) it’s important to make sure all data are discoverable, accessible, well-documented, and preserved across all partners. Creating a recommended repository list can support project partners by:\n\nSimplifying choices for where to publish and/or search for data\nIdentifying repositories that meet specific project needs, such as supporting the CARE principles for Indigenous Data Sovereignty or providing custom metadata tags that feed into a project data catalog\nAvoiding confusion between data repositories that provide long-term data access and storage, and other data tools and platforms (e.g. ERDDAP) that do not\n\nSince repositories often have data structure requirements, it’s valuable to know where data will eventually be published before data collection starts, so processes can be set up accordingly (see DMSP guide).\nThis list is designed for discussion with a project team or organization, ideally one including data managers, data users, and researchers, so that each project or organization can make transparent decisions about which criteria are important to them and where best to share their data. There may not be a perfect solution for every data type, and in choosing a repository list the team will have to decide what options are “good enough.” Documenting the repository selection process and guiding partners to long-term storage and access solutions contributes to ocean data stewardship and making more ocean data FAIR, useful, and (re)used.\n\n\n\nTechnical Criteria\n\nUnique Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)\n\nAssigns PIDs to datasets\nEach PID points to a persistent landing page\n\nSecurity and Integrity\n\nHave documented criteria for preventing unauthorized access, modification, or release of data\nHave security levels appropriate to the sensitivity of data\nImplement data anonymization as appropriate\n\nConfidentiality as necessary\n\nEnsure administrative, technical, and physical safeguards\n\n\n\n\nData Criteria\n\nCommon formats\n\nEnable easier dataset and metadata to be download, access, or export\nSupport widely used and non-proprietary formats for data and metadata\n\nData types\n\nClear communication of the types of data that can be ingested or stored\n\nData Connections\n\nClearn communication of the API standards or other requirements for connected data sources\n\n\n\n\nManagement / Curation Criteria\n\nLong-term Sustainability\n\nProvide long-term management of data\nMaintain availability of datasets\nHave stable technical infrastructure\nHave stable funding\nHave contingency plan for natural disasters and other events\n\nCuration and Quality Assurance\n\nEnsures datasets have metadata\nStandardized quality of record or dataset title\nInformative, short, descriptive abstracts or summaries about a dataset or record\n*Provide or enable others to provide expert curation\n\nRetention Policy\n\nHave a policy for data retention\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation Criteria\n\nMetadata Support\n\nUse schemas appropriate to the community\nInclude search keywords to make datasets discoverable\n*Include Local Contexts or other Indigenous Knowledge labels as appropriate\n\nProvenance Support\n\nRecord the origins, chain of custody, and modifications of the data\n*Link datasets to provide context and aid in discoverability\n\n\n\n\nData Use / Reuse / Sharing Criteria\n\nDiscoverability\n\nUse PIDs\n*Repository is federated with other repositories\n*Repository is listed in a federated catalog\n\nFree and Easy Access\n\nProvide no cost to access datasets and metadata\nSupport broad, equitable, open access\nProvide timely access after submission\n\nBroad and Measured Reuse\n\nHave broadest possible terms of reuse\nMeasure attribution, citation, and reuse\n\nClear Use Guidance\n\nClearly documented terms for access and reuse\n\n\n\n\nManagement & Governance Criteria\n\nSupporting restricted access\n\nHave a roles-based access management process\nDescribe parameters that can be defined for each role\nKeep access logs\nMaintain privacy, confidentiality, tribal sovereignty, and protection of sensitive data\n\n\n\n\nPricing Criteria\n\nAccount Pricing Information\n\nStorage size / data amount\nNumber of users\nSpecific features or services (e.g. visualization)\n\nAvailability of discounts\n\n*Volume discounts\n*Nonprofit organization discounts\n\n\n\n\nCertification Criteria\n\n*Repository is certified by CoreTrustSeal\n\n\n\nResources and Guidelines\nFAIR Criteria\nCARE Criteria\nWhite House Guidelines (aka NSTC guidelines)\nNIH guidelines\nCenter for Open Science re: guidelines\nBelmont Forum\nOpenAIRE PLOS\nTaylor and Francis\nSwiss NSF\nFAIRsharing and DataCite\nCOAR\nO’Brien et al. 2024 Earth Science Data Repositories: Implementing the CARE Principles.

These are questions that Intertidal thinks are important to think about, discuss among your team, and plan for when practicing good data stewardship. However, DMSPs are created by different organizations and people for different audiences and to serve different purposes. Therefore, the content listed below can be thought of as a menu from which you might choose to assemble a DMSP that suits your needs.\nIt is also important to consider how explicit or prescriptive you want or need to be. DMSPs are useful tools in the stewardship of data, yet they have usually been viewed as an annoying box-checking task without much further use. However, DMSPs can be very customized, and used to educate and guide users to implement robust data stewardship practices. In addition, the implementation of machine-actionable DMSPs promises greater utility in the future for tracking provenance and relationships between data and other research outputs, and in crediting the many people who steward the data throughout its lifecycle.",
