    "text": "Background\nWhen storing data, the question of where to put it for long-term access and reuse (&gt;40 years) often comes up. The best place to put it is in a repository; a persistent, findable, searchable entity that provides infrastructure for long-term storage and access to data. A repository should provide for data publication by data holders, as well as access for using/reusing data. It should not be a place into which data is contributed without any way to retrieve it in the future. To evaluate whether data places are robust repositories, Intertidal has developed the following criteria to help data stewards make their own decisions. Not all criteria will be applicable to everyone, but each data steward or organization deciding where to put their data should make transparent decisions about which criteria are important to them and document how those decisions are made.\n\n\nTechnical Criteria\n\nUnique Persistent Identifiers\n\nAssigns PIDs to datasets\nPID points to persistent landing page\n\nSecurity and Integrity\n\nDocumented criteria for preventing unauthorized access, modification, or release of data\nSecurity levels appropriate to the sensitivity of data\nData anonymization\n\nConfidentiality\n\nEnsure administrative, technical, and physical safeguards\n\n\n\n\nData Criteria\n\nWhat types of data can be ingested / stored?\nFor connected data sources, API standards? Other requirements?\nCommon Format\n\nAllows datasets and metadata to be downloaded, accessed, or exported\nSupport for widely used and non-proprietary formats for data and metadata\n\n\n\n\nManagement / Curation Criteria\n\nLong-term Sustainability\n\nLong-term management of data\nMaintain availability of dataset\nStable technical infrastructure\nStable funding\nContingency plan for data\n\nCuration and Quality Assurance\n\nProvide or enable others to provide expert curation\nDatasets must have metadata\nTitles of records/datasets should be standardized in quality, if not content, across a given portal/repo/catalog\nShort descriptive blurbs/abstracts/summaries about a dataset/record should be informative but not overly long and wordy. These should be curated.\n\nRetention Policy\n\nPolicy for data retention\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation Criteria\n\nMetadata Criteria\n\nDatasets must have metadata\nUse schemas appropriate to the community\nInclude search keywords to make dataset discoverable\n\nProvenance Criteria\n\nRecord the origins, chain of custody, and modifications of the data\nLink datasets to provide context and aid in discoverability\n\n\n\n\nData Use / Reuse / Sharing Criteria\n\nDiscoverability\n\nRepository federated with other repositories\nRepository listed in a wider catalog/federation/etc. that can be a one-stop-shop pointer to datasets\nShould use PIDs or UIDs, not website URLs (break frequently)\n\nFree and Easy Access\n\nFree access to datasets and metadata\nSupport for broad, equitable, open access\nTimely access after submission\nMaintain privacy, confidentiality, tribal sovereignty, and protection of sensitive data\n\nBroad and Measured Reuse\n\nBroadest possible terms of reuse\nMeasure attribution, citation, and reuse\n\nClear Use Guidance\n\nClear documentation of terms for access and reuse\n\n\n\n\nManagement & Governance\n\nFor a restricted access repository\n\nRoles-based access management process\nHow many roles can we have\nWhat parameters can we define for each role\nAccess logs?\n\n\n\n\nPricing\n\nHow are accounts priced\n\nStorage size / data amount\nNumber of users\nSpecific features\nOther\n\nNonprofit discount?\n\n\n\nBonus\n\nRepository is certified by CoreTrustSeal\n\n\n\nResources and Other Guidelines\nFAIR Criteria\nCARE Criteria\nWhite House Guidelines (aka NSTC guidelines)\nNIH guidelines\nCenter for Open Science re: guidelines\nBelmont Forum\nOpenAIRE PLOS\nTaylor and Francis\nSwiss NSF\nFAIRsharing and DataCite\nCOAR",

    "text": "Background\nMetadata describing every dataset, data products, and written article is needed to ensure that these resources can be found, accessed, and reused. If you are publishing data in a robust repository, these metadata recommendations may be met or exceeded by those of the repository.
