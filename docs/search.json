    "text": "Welcome to Intertidal’s resource home for ocean data stewards! \nData stewardship is central to Intertidal’s work connecting ocean data to action. Data stewards are individuals and teams within governments, communities, research groups, nonprofits, and businesses who make data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (aka FAIR). Without ocean data stewards, it’s much harder to find and recombine ocean data to make new discoveries, monitor ocean conditions, and design solutions. Anyone who works with ocean data and information can practice ocean data stewardship. These are some of the resources we’ve developed and tested with our partners. Try them out and see how they can support your ocean data stewardship practices.\n To submit feedback, ask questions or suggest additional topics you’d like to see added, please contact us.",

    "text": "Background\nWhen storing data, the question of where to put it for long-term access and reuse (&gt;40 years) often comes up. The best place to put it is in a repository; a persistent, findable, searchable entity that provides infrastructure for long-term storage and access to data. A repository should provide for data publication by data holders, as well as access for using/reusing data. It should not be a place into which data is contributed without any way to retrieve it in the future. To evaluate whether data places are robust repositories, Intertidal has developed the following criteria to help data stewards make their own decisions. Not all criteria will be applicable to everyone, but each data steward or organization deciding where to put their data should make transparent decisions about which criteria are important to them and document how those decisions are made.\n\n\nCriteria\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Must have \n    Nice to have \n  \n \n\n  Technical Criteria\n\n    Unique Persistent Identifiers \n    Assign PIDs to datasets \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    PIDs point to persistent landing page \n     \n  \n  \n    Security and Integrity \n    Have documented criteria for preventing unauthorized access, modification, or release of data \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Have security levels appropriate to the sensitivity of data \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Implement data anonymization as appropriate \n     \n  \n  \n    Confidentiality as necessary \n    Ensure administrative, technical, and physical safeguards \n     \n  \n  Data Criteria\n\n    Common formats \n    Enable easier dataset and metadata downloaded, access, or export \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Support widely used and non-proprietary formats for data and metadata \n     \n  \n  \n    Data types \n    Clear communication of the types of data that can be ingested or stored \n     \n  \n  \n    Connected data places \n    Clear communication of the API standards or other requirements for connected data sources \n     \n  \n  Management/Curation Criteria\n\n    Long-term Sustainability \n    Provide long-term management of data \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Maintain availability of datasets \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Have stable technical infrastructure \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Have stable funding \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Have contingency plan for data \n     \n  \n  \n    Curation and Quality Assurance \n    Datasets must have metadata \n    Provide or enable others to provide expert curation \n  \n  \n     \n    Standardized quality of record/dataset titles \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Informative, short descriptive abstracts/summaries about a dataset/record \n     \n  \n  \n    Retention Policy \n    Policy for data retention \n     \n  \n  Documentation Criteria\n\n    Metadata Support \n    Datasets must have metadata \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Use schemas appropriate to the community \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Include search keywords to make dataset discoverable \n     \n  \n  \n    Provenance Support \n    Record the origins, chain of custody, and modifications of the data \n    Link datasets to provide context and aid in discoverability \n  \n  Data Use/Reuse/Sharing Criteria\n\n    Discoverability \n    Use PIDs \n    Repository federated with other repositories \n  \n  \n     \n     \n    Repository listed in a wider catalog/federation/etc. that can be a one-stop-shop pointer to datasets \n  \n  \n    Free and Easy Access \n    No cost to access datasets and metadata \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Support for broad, equitable, open access \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Timely access after submission \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Maintain privacy, confidentiality, tribal sovereignty, and protection of sensitive data \n     \n  \n  \n    Broad and Measured Reuse \n    Have broadest possible terms of reuse \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Measure attribution, citation, and reuse \n     \n  \n  \n    Clear Use Guidance \n    Clearly documented terms for access and reuse \n     \n  \n  Management & Governance Criteria\n\n    For supporting restricted access \n    Have a roles-based access management process \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Define how many roles can an person can have \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Describe parameters that can be defined for each role \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Keep access logs \n     \n  \n  Pricing Criteria\n\n    Account pricing information \n    Storage size / data amount \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Number of users \n     \n  \n  \n     \n    Specific features \n     \n  \n  \n    Availability of discounts \n     \n    Volume discounts \n  \n  \n     \n     \n    Nonproft organization discounts \n  \n  Certification Criteria\n\n    Certification \n     \n    Certified by CoreTrust Seal \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Resources and Guidelines\nFAIR Criteria\nCARE Criteria\nWhite House Guidelines (aka NSTC guidelines)\nNIH guidelines\nCenter for Open Science re: guidelines\nBelmont Forum\nOpenAIRE PLOS\nTaylor and Francis\nSwiss NSF\nFAIRsharing and DataCite\nCOAR",

These are questions that Intertidal thinks are important to think about, discuss among your team, and plan for when practicing good data stewardship. However, DMSPs are created by different organizations and people for different audiences and to serve different purposes. Therefore, the content listed below can be thought of as a menu from which you might choose to assemble a DMSP that suits your needs.\nIt is also important to consider how explicit or prescriptive you want or need to be. DMSPs are useful tools in the stewardship of data, yet they have usually been viewed as an annoying box-checking task without much further use. However, DMSPs can be very customized, and used to educate and guide users to implement robust data stewardship practices. In addition, the implementation of machine-actionable DMSPs promises greater utility in the future for tracking provenance and relationships between data and other research outputs, and in crediting the many people who steward the data throughout its lifecycle.",
