These places are [data repositories](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-32001-4_59-1); *persistent, findable, searchable entities that provides infrastructure for long-term storage and access to data.*  A repository should provide for data publication by data holders, as well as access for using/reusing data. It should not be a place into which data is contributed without any way to retrieve it in the future. Intertidal has developed this list of repository evaluation criteria that synthesizes multiple sources (see [Resources and Guidelines](#resources-and-guidelines)), and indicates \"should have\" criteria (no asterisk) and \"nice to have\" criteria (asterisk).  \n\n\nIndividual researchers and data holders may already have preferred subject matter repositories where they regularly publish and access data (e.g. the Global Biodiversity Information Forum, aka GBIF). However, for projects that span a wide range of fields and data types (e.g. eDNA, underwater video, satellite images, socioeconomic data) it’s important to make sure all data are discoverable, accessible, well-documented, and preserved across all partners. Creating a recommended repository list can support project partners by:\n\n-   Simplifying choices for where to publish and/or search for data\n-   Identifying repositories that meet specific project needs, such as supporting the CARE principles for Indigenous Data Sovereignty or providing custom metadata tags that feed into a project data catalog\n-   Avoiding confusion between data repositories that provide long-term data access and storage, and other data tools and platforms (e.g. ERDDAP) that do not\n\nSince repositories often have data structure requirements, it’s valuable to know where data will eventually be published before data collection starts, so processes can be set up accordingly (see DMSP guide). \n\n\nThis list is designed for discussion with a project team or organization, ideally one including data managers, data users, and researchers, so that each project or organization can make transparent decisions about which criteria are important to them and where best to share their data. There may not be a perfect solution for every data type, and in choosing a repository list the team will have to decide what options are “good enough.”  Documenting the repository selection process and guiding partners to long-term storage and access solutions contributes to ocean data stewardship and making more ocean data FAIR, useful, and (re)used.\n\n\n<!-- ### Criteria -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Technical Criteria\n\n-   Unique Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)\n    -
